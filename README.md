This is the repository for DisCourse's Data Driven Discovery (DDD) platform. This is where we analyze data from courses and students to draw insights that we can leverage to accomplish our goals.

## Data Driven Course Discovery

When students are looking to register for courses for the next school term, they are currently only given information relevant to them graduating on time. Instead, students should have more information available to them to analyze courses. Going above and beyond, we want students to know things like career impact and course content, on top of additional course metadata (GPA, walking distance to landmarks, etc.) to get the big picture. We'd like to be able to answer the question: how are the courses that I take now going to affect me in the future, outside of my college requirements?
